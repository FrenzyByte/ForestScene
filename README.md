This project is the scene used in the [Fluid Frenzy - Forest Demo](https://frenzy-byte.itch.io/fluid-frenzy-demo-forest). 

It makes use of some downsampled verions of the assets from the [Unity Terrain URP Demo Scene](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/unity-terrain-urp-demo-scene-213197) to save space.

To run the demo with the the [Fluid Frenzy](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fluid-frenzy-273366) simulation you will need to install the asset in the project yourself.
